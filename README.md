# Hello everyone! 👋

### My name is Aris, and I’m a Software Engineer / Frontend Developer. I’m from Mexico, living in a growing city called Queretaro, and currently working for a national retail company called _Galileo_.

- 🔭 I'm currently working mainly with **Next.js** alongside other modern technologies and tools such as **Tailwind**, **Storybook**, **Vite**, and **GraphQL**. Also working with **Odoo** every now and then as part of my job as a dev. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about **Monorepo** strategies and fooling around with **Astro** using **Svelte** for my component library, and speaking about my soft skills I'm training to become a better leader and collaborator.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate with tech teams looking forward to building a safe space to communicate and work as a team and with companies that care about the career paths of their devs.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my career path as a Software Engineer and how I can become a better collaborator, developer, leader and above all, a better person.
